# Mininet-YAML

This small tool allows creating virtual network using [Mininet](https://mininet.org/) by providing a network topology description in YAML format.

## Gettings started

First of all, you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the tool by providing the path to the YAML file. You can test the tool by running the following command:

```bash
python main.py topology.example.yaml
``./your/topology.yml`
