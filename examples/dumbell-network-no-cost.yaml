#
# This yaml file describes a simple dumbell network with two routers (r1 and r2) and 3 hosts per side.
#
# The network topology is as follows:
#
# (h1,h2,h3) --- r1 --- r2 --- (h4,h5,h6)
#

routers:
  # Router 1 - left side of the dumbell
  r1:
    # Interface where users connect to
    eth0:
      address: 192.168.0.1
      mask: 255.255.255.240

    # Intra-router interface
    eth1:
      address: 10.0.2.1
      mask: 255.255.255.0
    
  # Router 2 - right side of the dumbell
  r2:
    # Intra-router interface
    eth0:
      address: 10.0.2.2
      mask: 255.255.255.0

    # Interface where other users can connect to
    eth1:
      address: 192.168.1.1
      mask: 255.255.255.0    

hosts:
  # The left side of the dumbell
  h1:
    eth0:
      address: 192.168.0.5
      mask: 255.255.255.240
  h2:
    eth0:
