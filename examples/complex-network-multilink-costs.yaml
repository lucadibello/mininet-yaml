#
# This yaml file describes a more complex network with three routers (r1, r2, and r3) and 4 hosts. In this case,
# the routers have multiple possible interfaces to connect to other routers or hosts. The underlying algorithm will
# automatically determine the best connection between routers and hosts based on the cost of the connection, and setup
# failover paths in case of link failures.
#
# The virtual network emulator will also propagate the routing tables between routers, so that all routers know how to
# reach all hosts in the network.
