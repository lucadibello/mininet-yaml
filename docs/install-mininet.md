# Install Mininet on your system

Mininet offers a simple way to create virtual networks for testing and development purposes. It is a great tool to experiment with different network topologies without the need for physical setups. Pre-built packages are available for most Linux distributions.

Depending on your distribution, you can install Mininet using the following commands:

### Debian-based systems

```bash
sudo apt-get install mininet
```

### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install mininet
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S mininet
```

### MacOS

Unfortunately, Mininet is not officially supported on MacOS. However, you can use a virtual machine with a Linux distribution to run Mininet, such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html), [Multipass](https://multipass.run/), or [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com/).

Mininet offers pre-built VM images that you can download from the [official website](http://mininet.org/download/).
