# Install Mininet on your system

Mininet offers a simple way to create virtual networks for testing and development purposes. It is a great tool to experiment with different network topologies without the need for physical setups. Pre-built packages are available for most Linux distributions and MacOS (via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)).

Depending on your system you can install Mininet using the following commands:

### Debian-based systems

```bash
sudo apt-get install mininet
```

### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install mininet
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S mininet
```

### MacOS

```bash
brew install mininet
```

### Building from source / other systems

You can find relevant instructions on the [official Mininet website](http://mininet.org/download/).
